**Project Title:** DonorsChoose Project Approval Classification

**Description:**
- In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify whether educational projects submitted on DonorsChoose would be approved or not. Leveraging a diverse dataset that included project descriptions, funding goals, and various demographic features, the goal was to uncover key factors influencing project approval.

**Methodology:**
- I employed a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and traditional machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost, to build robust predictive models. The process involved:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the dataset to handle missing values and categorical variables, ensuring it was suitable for model training. This included text normalization techniques such as lowercasing, removing punctuation, and tokenization.

- NLP Feature Extraction: Applied NLP techniques to extract meaningful insights from project descriptions. I utilized methods such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec) to convert text into numerical representations that capture contextual meanings. Additionally, I performed sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional tone of the descriptions, which could be indicative of project success.

- Feature Engineering: Combined the NLP-derived features with structured data like funding goals and the type of project to create a comprehensive feature set, enhancing model performance.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Trained multiple models, tuning hyperparameters for optimization. Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a balanced performance, particularly given the potential class imbalance in project approvals.

- Results Analysis: Analyzed model outputs to identify the most influential factors affecting project approval. The insights derived not only provided guidance for future project submissions but also highlighted the role of compelling descriptions in securing funding.

This project enhanced my skills in both machine learning and NLP, demonstrating the power of combining structured and unstructured data to tackle complex classification problems in real-world scenarios.
